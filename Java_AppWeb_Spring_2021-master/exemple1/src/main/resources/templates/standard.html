<h1>Novel</h1>
<p>A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction,
typically written in prose and published as a book.
The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian:
novella for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the Latin: novella,
a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus,
diminutive of novus, meaning "new".[1]A novel is a relatively long
work of narrative fiction, typically written in prose and published as a book.
